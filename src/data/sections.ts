  pullQuote: "Ponraj is a dynamic talent. Raised in Seattle, she is of Indian, German and English descent. ",
  content: `At 17, she moved to Los Angeles to forge a multi-hyphenate career. 

An accomplished vocalist, her latest EP, BLADE, is a bold sonic and visual experience that has garnered glowing reviews. She followed it with the provocatively charged “Under Your Skin,” which she wrote and performed for the end credits of The Exorcists, where she starred opposite horror icon Doug Bradley. 

As an actress, she has lent her voice to several major video game franchises and is currently a voice for Taco Bell. She has been the face of Fujifilm, HIPPEAS, and other notable brands, with collaborations spanning Nike, Live Nation, VIDEMUS OMNIA, EM Cosmetics, and more. 

As a songwriter, her work has been praised as “earnest, enticing, and poignant.” Her forthcoming literary memoir, Runaway, further cements a riveting and elegant young voice. 

This year, she stars as the troubled wife of an astronaut in Angad Aulakh’s sci-fi Aurora.`
